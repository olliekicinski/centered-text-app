<li>If you want to get <b>wealthy or achieve freedom</b> it has to be your number on desire. If you face resistance that is feedback that you are going in the right direction.</li>
<li>Be careful on other people opinions or even facts - <b>what is true to others not necessary is true for you</b>.<b>Reject most advice</b>, ask questions: Is it true? WIll it work for you? If you want to check if something complex is true, analyze it based on foundations.

Be much more individual than society lets you, do not listen to whats true for others -  <b>Escape competition by authenticity</b>.</li>
<li>We are highly mimetic creatures, if everyone is doing something we also want to do it - <b>Do not get caught in that</b>.

Especially in entrepreneurship, masses are never right, don’t compete about things that are not worth competing for. Example: Status game - fighting for status is a zero sum game, to win someone needs to lose.</li>
<li><b>Play long term. </b>Avoid fast lifestyle upgrade even when earning more money.
- <b>compound interest is the most important.</b><br></li>
<li><b>Failures are just feedback from society</b>, and <b>Money is return on investment from society.</b> Learn to live with failures and only win from time to time but big. <b>People will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made high integrity effort. </b>You will be rewarded in proportion to your accountability, so embrace it and take business risks under your own name.</li>
<li><b>Specific knowledge</b> (is the edge of knowledge in something):

If something is natural (you are obsessed) to you, eventually you will figure it out. - Fun to you, work to others.

You cannot be trained for specific knowledge. if you want to be irreplaceable, you can be thought only fundamentals, then you have to figure it out by doing.

Intellect without experience is more than useless, cause you have confidence of the intellect but you have no real experience and you are throwing darts.</li>
<li><b>Types of leverages:</b>Labour work (it is hard to manage people)
Capital work (easier to menage but you have to acquire capital)
No cost of replication (easy to gain, more benefits, less work - code, media)<b>Combining these 3 types of leverages makes best high tech companies.</b><br></li>
<li><b>How to start a business from scratch pick something that contains:</b>Network effect - each additional user ads value for the existing data base.
Low marginal cost
Scale economy - use different leverages.</li>
<li><b>Judgement is knowing the long term effects of decisions</b>. Reputation that makes people do deals through you is based on your Judgement. Emotions are clouding your Judgement.<b>Business is about trust, do not do to others what you do not want others do to you. Compound interest in relationships is as powerful, as with capital. </b></li>
<li><b>No-one will value you more that you value yourself</b>, so you should set very high hourly rate and stick to it.

Always factor time and mental hustle in every decision and if it is worth it to do something. If not hire someone so it can be done for you.</li>
<li><b>If you want to really meet someone your calling card has to be good:</b>Hey, here is what I have done, here is what I can show you,
lets meet if it is useful to you and I will be respectful with your time.

Earn credibility to be respected - <b>your product/ results is your best resume.</b></li>
<li><b>Only 3 things you will have time for when starting the business:</b>Working on product market fit
Exercising
Eating healthy</li>
<li><b>How to pick people:</b>Smart at your thing
High energy in your thing
High integrity (look what they do not say) - how they treat others
Rational Optimists (Lead, follow or get out the way)<b>If you cannot imagine to work with somebody for 10 years do not work for a day</b></li>
<li><b>You work as hard as you can on things that you think are most important due to your goal</b>.
Hard work is important but what you work on is probably the most important thing. Sprint on something that you are inspired, then rest, look back, reassess and try again.</li>
<li><b>Inspiration is not stable, when you fell it do the work or you will lose it.</b> Impatient with actions and patient with results. <b>Everything over time has compound effect, be patient</b> 
We squander our time by a death of a thousand cuts - <b>you should be too busy to do meeting while still keeping uncluttered calendar.</b></li>
<li><b>Money will solve only your money problems.</b> When you will be finally wealthy you will realize that it is not what you were seeking in the first place. Money just lets you do not do things you do not want to do. <b>Calm mind, healthy body, house full of love - these things cannot be bought.</b>There is not easy, fast haw to get rich schemes, it is someone making money from you - If someone has something to sell to you, keep distance to what is he saying.</li>
<li><b>You should find 3 hobbies:</b>One that makes you money
One that makes you fit
One that makes you smarter (you become calm when you get smarter)</li>
<li><b> Principal Agent Problem:</b>Principal (Owner) of the business wants best for the business and what will make most money.

Agent (Employee) wants what will look good to the owner, will make him most friends or most money (to him).<u>If you are principal</u> take best agents and be generous with ownership and intended even if they do not realize it, over time they will and you want them to be alined with you. It is better to have aligned partnership where you both have same intensives than having advantage, because over time 		someone will figure it out and your partnership will not stand the decades to compound interest on your deal.<u>If you are agent</u> think like a principal, the more you think that way the best you will be long term. Eventually you will be a principal or you will aline 	with principal and they will promote (give you leverage and accountability)<b>If there is someone above you then that is someone to learn from if you are not learning from them then it should not be anyone above you. If there is someone below you, you are teaching them if not get a robot instead.</b> Avoid repetitive simple work - hire someone or get a robot instead. 

If you want something done do it yourself because others simply do not care. 

Always work with smaller companies even if you are principal and looking for contractor. The less separation between agent and principal the better.</li>
<li><b>Negotiations are won by whoever cares less.</b></li>
<li><b>You can charge people differently based on their ability to pay</b> - just offer them something extra what is important to them.</li>
<li><b>Self-discipline is most underrated skill</b>, when you lose motivation it keeps you rolling, feel where dopamine pulls you, go opposite direction and you will do best.</li>
<li><b>Law of Vibration.</b> Like attracts like energy, so <b>be careful what you focus on</b>, because this is what you are going to find in the world.</li>
<li> <b>Law of Relativity.</b> Do not define something by comparing to something else. Compare yourself to you from the past, not to others, because it does not matter and only drains your energy and focus.</li>
<li><b>Law of Cause and Effect. </b>Tired? Broke? That’s an effect of some cause that made it happened. Try to reengineer it, and focus on causes not on effects. What effects would you like to attract? Plan it and this can happen.</li>
<li><b>Law of Polarity. </b>Everything has its opposite, so always focus on what you want to be and not what you do not want. This will attract the „better” energy.</li>
<li><b>Law of Rhythm.</b> The only constant in life is change. Sun goes up and sun goes down. Tomorrow is always a new day and you can change everything. It is always darkest before the dawn.</li>
<li><b>Law of Gestation. </b>Everything in life takes time. The ideas that you plant today won’t show effects tomorrow, but after weeks/ months/ years of consistent effort the results are going to be exponential. For others it will look like overnight success, but you will know that you put years of consistent effort to achieve this state.</li>
<li><b>Law of Transmutation. </b>Energy moves in and out of physical form. You can take creative, sexual, spiritual or physical energy and focus it on whatever you would like to get out of this world. For example nofap is transmuting sexual energy to achieve desired outcomes, like for example physical energy. Second example is that you can transmit binge eating, anxiety energy to physical or creative or sexual energy, thus making it useful.</li>
